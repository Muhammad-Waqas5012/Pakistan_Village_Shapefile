# Pakistan Village Shapefiles
These are village-level shapefiles for districts in Punjab, Pakistan. They were created by running a Voronoi tessellation on the following shapefile (https://data.humdata.org/dataset/pakistan-settlement), which contains the latitudes and longitudes of human settlements in Pakistan. The tesselation creates polygons from input points, such that any point within the polygon is closer to the input point than any other input point.
